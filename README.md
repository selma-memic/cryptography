# 🔐 Cryptography

This repository contains three applied cryptography projects developed during my Erasmus studies at the University of Bologna for the course **Elements of Applied Data Security**. The projects cover core concepts in modern and classical cryptography, implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📁 Projects Overview

Each project is organized in its own folder and contains a Jupyter Notebook with explanations, code, and test results.

### 1. 🔤 Substitution Ciphers
**Folder**: `SubstitutionCiphers/`  
This notebook explores classical substitution techniques including Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Substitution, and the Vigenère Cipher. It includes both encryption and decryption methods along with frequency analysis.

### 2. 🔒 Block Ciphers
**Folder**: `BlockCiphers/`  
Covers the principles of block ciphers such as DES and AES. Implements basic encryption and decryption schemes using Python libraries, and explains the structure of these algorithms (e.g., Feistel Networks, S-boxes, modes of operation like ECB/CBC).

### 3. ⚡ Stream Ciphers
**Folder**: `StreamCiphers/`  
Focuses on stream ciphers, with implementations of LFSRs and pseudo-random keystream generators. Also includes examples of XOR-based stream encryption and a discussion of security implications.
